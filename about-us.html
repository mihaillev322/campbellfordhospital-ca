<h1>About Civic Pantry Index and our food pantry data method</h1>

<section id="mission" aria-labelledby="mission-heading">
<h2 id="mission-heading">Mission and audience</h2>
<p>Civic Pantry Index exists to help communities publish accurate, ethical pantry directories. Our mission centers on a simple observation: food assistance information is only valuable when it reflects reality. A directory filled with outdated hours, disconnected phone numbers, and closed locations does more harm than good—it wastes the time and resources of people already facing hardship. We provide the methodology and standards that enable directory maintainers to do better.</p>

<p>Our primary audiences include librarians who maintain community resource guides, mutual aid groups coordinating local food access, campus services staff supporting students facing food insecurity, local reporters covering hunger and poverty issues, and civic technologists building tools for social good. Each of these groups shares a common need: reliable frameworks for gathering, verifying, and presenting food pantry information. We serve that need through clear documentation, practical checklists, and transparent explanations of our reasoning.</p>

<p>The Swiss-typography editorial approach you see throughout this site reflects our commitment to clarity, hierarchy, and verifiable claims. Every design choice serves comprehension: generous whitespace reduces cognitive load, consistent heading structures enable scanning, and semantic HTML ensures accessibility. We avoid decorative elements that distract from content. This approach extends to our writing: we make claims we can support, we cite sources, and we acknowledge limitations honestly.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>"Transparency is not optional in public service. Every claim should be traceable, every limitation acknowledged, every source documented."</p>
</blockquote>

<section id="standards" aria-labelledby="standards-heading">
<h2 id="standards-heading">Editorial standards and verification checklist</h2>
<p>Our editorial standards govern how we approach information quality, and we recommend these same standards to anyone building a pantry directory. The foundation is source logging: for every piece of information you publish, record where it came from and when you obtained it. This practice enables accountability, supports future verification, and helps identify patterns in data quality across sources.</p>

<p>Last-verified dates belong on every listing. A date tells users how much trust to place in the information and signals when re-verification is due. Change notes document what was updated and why, creating an audit trail that helps maintainers understand the directory's evolution. These practices may seem bureaucratic for small directories, but they prevent the gradual decay that renders unmaintained directories useless. The <a href="https://www.nngroup.com/articles/ten-usability-heuristics/">Nielsen Norman Group's usability heuristics</a> inform our emphasis on visibility of system status—users deserve to know how current information is.</p>

<p>Accessibility is a core standard, not an afterthought. We use readable tables with proper header markup and scope attributes. All interactive elements are keyboard-accessible. We avoid image-only content that screen readers cannot parse. Color choices maintain sufficient contrast ratios. These practices ensure that people with disabilities—who may face compounding barriers to food access—can use directories built on our methodology.</p>

<p>Our corrections policy is straightforward: if you identify an error in our guidance or have suggestions for improvement, contact us at <a href="mailto:corrections@example.com">corrections@example.com</a>. We review all submissions, verify claims, and update content with appropriate change notes. The <a href="https://www.loc.gov/programs/national-digital-information-infrastructure-and-preservation-program/about-this-program/">Library of Congress digital stewardship principles</a> inform our approach to maintaining information integrity over time.</p>

<section id="limitations" aria-labelledby="limitations-heading">
<h2 id="limitations-heading">Limitations, disclaimers, and responsible use</h2>
<p>Civic Pantry Index provides educational guidance about food pantry data methodology. We do not guarantee the availability of services at any specific pantry, and users must confirm details directly before traveling. Food assistance resources change frequently—hours shift, locations move, eligibility requirements evolve, and organizations occasionally close. No static guide can substitute for direct communication with the pantries you intend to visit.</p>

<p>This site focuses exclusively on the United States. Food assistance systems vary dramatically across countries, and our guidance reflects US-specific contexts: the role of 211 services, USDA program structures, and common nonprofit organizational patterns. International readers may find general principles useful, but specific recommendations assume a US context.</p>

<p>We strongly encourage readers to consult local 211 resources for real-time referrals. Dialing 211 connects callers to trained specialists who can assess needs and provide current information about available services. Official agencies—county social services departments, state health and human services offices, and USDA Food and Nutrition Service resources—provide authoritative information that complements community-maintained directories.</p>
